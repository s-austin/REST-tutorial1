REST is acronym for REpresentational State Transfer. It is architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems and was first presented by Roy Fielding in 2000 in his famous dissertation.'''

#### Guiding Principles of REST

##### Client–server – By separating the user interface concerns from the data storage concerns, we improve the portability of the user interface across multiple platforms and improve scalability by simplifying the server components.

#### LESSON LEARNED: Separation of concerns, user interface versus data storage

##### Stateless – Each request from client to server must contain all of the information necessary to understand the request, and cannot take advantage of any stored context on the server. Session state is therefore kept entirely on the client.

#### LESSON LEARNED1: Cannot take advantage of any stored context on the server. 
#### LESSON LEARNED2: Session state kept entirely on the client.
